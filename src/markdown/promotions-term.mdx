At The Book Haven, we love offering special promotions and discounts to our valued customers. These Promotion Terms and Conditions outline the rules and restrictions for participating in our promotional offers. By participating in any The Book Haven promotion, you agree to these terms.

## 1. General Terms

- All promotions are subject to availability and may be withdrawn or modified at any time without notice.

- Promotional offers are valid only for the duration specified in the promotion details and are subject to change or cancellation without prior notice.

## 2. Eligibility

- Promotions are open to all customers who meet the requirements specified in the promotion details.
- The Book Haven reserves the right to verify the eligibility of all participants and may disqualify anyone found to be in violation of these terms.

## 3. Promotional Codes

- **Usage**: Promotional codes must be entered at checkout to apply the discount. Codes cannot be applied to previous orders.
- **Limitations**: Each promotional code is limited to one use per customer unless stated otherwise.
- **Expiration**: All promotional codes have an expiration date and must be used before the specified date.

## 5. Free Gifts and Giveaways

- Any free gifts offered as part of a promotion are subject to availability and may be substituted with an item of equal or greater value.
- Free gifts cannot be exchanged, refunded, or redeemed for cash.
- If an order is returned or canceled, the free gift must also be returned, or its value will be deducted from the refund amount.

## 6. Refunds and Returns

- If you return an item purchased with a promotional discount, the refund will be based on the discounted price paid.
- If a minimum purchase amount was required to qualify for the promotion, and the return reduces the order total below that amount, the promotion may be void, and the discount or free gift may be forfeited.

- We are not responsible for any lost, delayed, or incomplete entries or technical errors that may prevent a promotional code from being applied.

## 9. Abuse and Misuse

- Any attempt to manipulate or abuse a promotion, including creating multiple accounts to redeem offers, will result in disqualification and may lead to order cancellation and account suspension.
- The Book Haven reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate action if promotional abuse is suspected.

## 10. Changes to Promotion Terms
